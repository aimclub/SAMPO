# Introduction

## Who is this guide for?

The guide is organized to help users with different levels of expertise:

* Introductory level — what SAMPO is, how it can help, and how to get started quickly.
* Advanced level — how to configure SAMPO for your tasks.

## What is SAMPO?

SAMPO is a framework for automated optimization of business process scheduling. It makes it possible to effectively
leverage accumulated corporate expertise based on retrospective data to automatically build schedules for executing
business processes that are optimal with respect to the required target metrics.

## Key features and benefits

SAMPO is based on metaheuristic, genetic, and neural network algorithms that make it possible to analyze retrospective
production data and solve the problem of multi-criteria optimization of planning, taking accumulated experience into
account. A distinguishing feature of the framework is its ability to efficiently solve the scheduling problem over long
time horizons, under uncertainty and with incomplete retrospective data.

By virtue of its modular structure, SAMPO supports the integration of algorithms and models that take into account the
specifics of a particular domain, so the framework can be applied to industrial problems across various sectors: mining
and manufacturing, construction, transportation, and energy.
