# Introduction

## Who is this guidebook for?

The guidebook is structured to help users with different levels of experience:

* Introductory level — what SAMPO is, how it can help, and how to get started quickly.
* Advanced level — how to customize SAMPO for your specific tasks.

## What is SAMPO?

**SAMPO** is a framework for automated optimization of business process planning.  
It enables effective use of accumulated corporate knowledge and historical data to automatically build business
process schedules optimized for the required performance indicators.

## Key Features and Advantages

SAMPO is built on **metaheuristic, genetic, and neural-network-based scheduling algorithms** that analyze historical
production data and solve the **multi-criteria project scheduling optimization** problem while leveraging accumulated
experience.  
A key feature of the framework is its ability to efficiently handle **long-term project schedules** under
uncertainty and with incomplete historical data.

Thanks to its **modular architecture**, SAMPO supports the integration of **domain-specific algorithms and models**.  
This makes the framework applicable to **industrial scheduling problems** across various sectors, including
mining and manufacturing, construction, transportation, and energy.
