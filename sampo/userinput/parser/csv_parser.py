            1) If you send WorkGraph .csv file without data about connections between tasks, you need to provide .csv
            history file - the SAMPO will be able to reconstruct the connections between tasks based on historical data.
            2) If you send WorkGraph .csv file with column 'predecessor_ids', 'lags' etc. and there is no info in these
            columns, so framework repair the info from history data
            3) If you don't put 'granular_name' and don't receive name_mapper to WorkGraph .csv file, thus you need to
            be sure that activity_name is correct and correlate to 'granular_name' in history .csv file
